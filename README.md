PixelSSL is a PyTorch-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) codebase for pixel-wise (Pixel) vision tasks.

The purpose of this project is to promote the research and application of semi-supervised learning on pixel-wise vision tasks. PixelSSL provides two major features:
- Interface for implementing new semi-supervised algorithms
- Template for encapsulating diverse computer vision tasks

As a result, the SSL algorithms integrated in PixelSSL are compatible with all task codes inherited from the given template. 

<!-- This project includes the code of our ECCV 2020 paper [Guided Collaborative Training for Pixel-wise Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05258) (GCT). -->
